# Polyhedron Operators

This crate implements the [Conway Polyhedron
Operators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_polyhedron_notation)
and their extensions by [George W. Hart](http://www.georgehart.com/)
and others.

*Some brutalist polyhedron; rendered with
[3Delight|ɴsɪ](https://www.3delight.com) and post processed in
[Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/).*

This is an experiment to improve my understanding of iterators in Rust.
It is based on [Kit Wallace](http://kitwallace.tumblr.com/tagged/conway)’s
OpenSCAD code. As OpenSCAD Language is functional it lends itself
well to translation into functional Rust.

```rust
use polyhedron_ops::Polyhedron;
use std::path::Path;

// Conway notation: gapcD
let polyhedron =
    Polyhedron::dodecahedron()  // D
        .chamfer(None, true)    // c
        .propellor(None, true)  // p
        .ambo(None, true)       // a
        .gyro(None, None, true) // g
        .finalize();

// Export as ./polyhedron-gapcD.obj
polyhedron.write_to_obj(&Path::new("."), false);
```

The above code starts from a
[dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron) and
iteratively applies four operators.

The resulting shape is shown below.

## Caveat

This is in a rough shape. Probably buggy. Documentation sucks.

In short: use at your own risk.

## Cargo Features

* `bevy` – Adds support for converting a polyhedron into a
           [`bevy`](https://bevyengine.org/)
           [`Mesh`](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/render/mesh/struct.Mesh.html).

* `nsi`  – Adds support for sending a polyhedron to an offline renderer
           via the [ɴsɪ](https://crates.io/crates/nsi/) crate.

* `obj`  – Adds support for writing data out as
           [Wavefront OBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file).

## Base Shapes

- [x] Platonic solids
- [x] Prisms
- [ ] Antiprisms
- [ ] Pyramids
- [ ] Johnson Solids

## Supported Operators

- [x] **a** - ambo
- [x] **b** - bevel (equiv. to **ta**)
- [x] **c** - chamfer
- [x] **d** - dual
- [x] **e** - expand (a.k.a. explode, equiv. to **aa**)
- [x] **g** - gyro
- [x] **i** - inset/loft (equiv. to **x,N**)
- [x] **j** - join (equiv. to **dad**)
- [x] **K** - Quick & dirty canonicalization
- [x] **k** - kis
- [x] **M** - medial (equiv. to **dta**)
- [x] **m** - meta (equiv. to **k,,3j**)
- [x] **n** - needle (equiv. to **dt**)
- [x] **o** - ortho (equiv. to **jj**)
- [x] **p** - propeller
- [x] **q** - quinto
- [x] **r** - reflect
- [x] **s** - snub (equiv. to **dgd**)
- [x] **t** - truncate (equiv. to **dkd**)
- [x] **v** - subdivide (Catmull-Clark)
- [x] **w** - whirl
- [x] **x** - extrude
- [x] **z** - zip (equiv. to **dk**)

### Other Operators

- [ ] **H** - hollow (called ‘intrude’ in Wings3D)
- [ ] **h** - hexpropellor
- [ ] **l** - stellate
- [ ] **z** - triangulate

## Playing

There is a playground example app to test things & have fun:

```
cargo run --release --example playground --features obj
```

If you want to produce images like the ones above you need to
[download the free version of the 3Delight renderer](https://www.3delight.com/download)
and install that. After that, run the example with
[ɴsɪ](https://crates.io/crates/nsi/) support:

```
cargo run --release --example playground --features nsi,obj
```

### Keyboard Commands

Use keys matching the operator name from the above list to apply.

Use `Up` and `Down` to adjust the parameter of the the last operator.
Combine with `Shift` for 10× the change.

`Delete` undoes the last (and only the last) operation.

Press `Enter` to render with 3Delight (requires a [3Delight|ɴsɪ
installation](https://www.3delight.com/download)).
Combine with `Shift` to render with 3Delight Cloud (requires
registration).

Press `Space` to save as `$HOME/polyhedron-<type>.obj`.

I use `kiss3d` for realtime preview which, [for now](https://github.com/sebcrozet/kiss3d/issues/263),
limits meshes to 64k vertices. This means the preview will be broken/missing bits
once your mesh hits this limit.

Export & render will always yield a correct OBJ though. Which you can
view in Wings, Blender or another DCC app.
